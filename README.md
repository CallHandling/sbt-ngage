# sbt-ngage
Plugin for scalafix, scalafmt and scoverage 

This sbt plugin is very useful when you have multi projects and way to use external code in a build definition. It has single place to define common libraries and plugins so other projects don't have to define these libs and plugins again.

It has a sequence of sbt settings that are automatically added to all projects or that are explicitly declared for selected projects.
